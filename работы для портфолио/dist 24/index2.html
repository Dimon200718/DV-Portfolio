					<h1 class="h1_1">WEB DEVELOPER</h1>
					<p class="t1">A web developer is a specialist who creates and maintains websites and applications. It can work both on the appearance of the site and on its internal, server side. Testing and searching for bugs is, although not the main one, but also one of the tasks of web programming. There are three big areas in the developer profession: frontend, backend, and fullstack. All of them are popular among developers:</p>

					<h2 >History of the specialty</h2>
					<img class="i2" src="img/image14.png">
					<p class="h_t">
						The profession of a web programmer appeared at the end of the last century, along with the Internet. Initially, sites were not very popular, so web programmers were not in great demand. But the more the world Putin penetrated people's lives, the higher the demand for specialists who could create Internet pages became. In recent years, the web industry has been developing rapidly: new languagesand rules, technologies and features are emerging.
					</p>
					<p class="h_t"> Working as a web programmer is good because it first of all requires knowledge and skills, not a diploma. You can become a professional at any age, and you don't even have to leave your home - many programmers work remotely, collaborate with foreign companies. But you need to be prepared for irregular working hours and frequent emergencies. Web developers are highly qualified professionals with a diploma of higher education, and sometimes several. </p>
					<p class="h_t">Full-stack developers of web software cover the demand from employers. They talk about the differences between server and client technologies and discuss the interaction "on two fronts". Finding such a professional is a great success, but also a worthy one. Then a model of the intended application is designed and the concept is worked out. The next stage is writing code, testing each of its tasks and eliminating flaws. First, a beta version is issued "on the mountain", and later - a full-fledged product. A team of craftsmen always works on the project, each of which is responsible for his own area of work.</p>

					<h2>Direction in web development</h2>
					<h4 class="h4_2">There are three areas in the field of web development:</h4>
					<ul class="ul1">
						<li><b>Front-end developer.</b> Such an employee concentrates on the visual part of the project, which includes the appearance of the resource, its interface, and all kinds of applications. It makes the use of each page of the site as comfortable as possible, that is, it focuses on the client side of the resource. Its main tools are CSS, HTML, JavaScript. This list is complemented by a whole list of programs designed to improve the site: Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS, LESS, Sass / SCSS, etc.</li>
						<li><b>Back-end developer.</b> This specialist is engaged in server technologies. It receives a user request from the front end, processes it, and passes it back in a form accessible to the client. What happens on the server side is not available to the user, he sees only the final result and cannot interfere with the application from the outside. The back-end developer uses the following tools: different programming languages(PHP, Perl, Java, Python, Ruby), frameworks (Kohana, Codeigniter, Yii), and MySQL for saving data.</li>
						<li><b>Full-stack developer.</b> This is a professional capable of working with both Back-end and Front-end website development. He must have knowledge of both types of development.</li>
